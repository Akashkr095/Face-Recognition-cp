# Face-Recognition-cp
The Facerec Attendance system is designed to automate and streamline attendance tracking in educational institutions and workplaces. By leveraging Python and advanced computer vision technologies, the system uses real-time facial recognition to accurately log attendance, reducing the time and resources associated with traditional methods. In a classroom with a large number of students, taking attendance manually can be a tedious and time-consuming task. Therefore, we can implement an effective system that automatically marks attendance by recognizing students' faces. The process of this face recognition system is divided into various steps, but the important steps include the detection of faces and the recognition of faces. Once a face is recognized, the system logs the attendance in a CSV file, allowing for easy record-keeping and reporting.
